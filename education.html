    <p id="msoc">For the past three years, I have had the privilege of being the student manager for the University of South Florida's men's soccer team. This role has been an invaluable part of my college experience, providing me with a plethora of opportunities to learn and grow. Grateful for the experiences and connections it has brought me, my time with the team has not only deepened my appreciation for soccer but has also become a constant source of inspiration for my creativity and imagination. I find that the dynamic nature of the sport stimulates my mind, enhancing the ideas I generate, especially in the realm of sports technology. It's truly fulfilling to be part of a community that fosters both my passion for soccer and my enthusiasm for exploring innovative solutions within the realm of sports and technology.</p>
    <p id="lotus">Over the past semester, I have had the privilege of being a consultant at LOTUS Consulting, where my role has been integral in fostering growth for small businesses and start-ups. Collaborating closely with these enterprises, I focused on marketing and sales strategies, meticulously studying their social media and sales landscapes to identify challenges and impediments. Implementing a comprehensive marketing plan, I, alongside my fellow consultants, successfully elevated companies' social media followings. Furthermore, through a thorough examination of sales plans within defined deadlines, we witnessed tangible improvements in overall sales performance. In parallel, I have been actively engaged in enhancing the technological aspects of these businesses, contributing to the development and optimization of their websites. This multifaceted experience has been particularly enriching for me, as someone who possesses a genuine passion for both business and technology, and I am excited about the positive impact our collaborative efforts have made on these enterprises.</p>
